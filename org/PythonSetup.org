* Installing Python
#+include: "./back-to-index.org"
** Objectives
1. Install a version of Python packaged in Anaconda or Miniconda
2. Create a virtual environment with a specific Python release
** Background (optional)
*** Virtual Environments
- You can use Python /without/ virtual environments, but things can get messy
  quickly
  - We typically add Python packages to extend its capabilities
  - Sometimes, different projects require different packages
    - Packages may conflict, or different projects may even require /different/
      versions of the same package, or even different versions of Python
    - Example: Suppose Project A requires packages W, U, and V, but Project B requires
      packages V, X, and Y. Some conflicts that can arise:
      - Package X may be incompatible with package U, rendering your code for
        Project A unusable. Remove package U, and you can no longer work on
        Project B
      - Project A and Project B might require different versions of package V
      - Project A and Project B might require different versions of Python
- To prevent such conflicts, it is customary to use *virtual environments*
  - A virtual environment is like a custom installation of Python with only those
    packages required for a specific project or application

*** Creating and Using Virtual Environments
- There are multiple ways to create virtual environments
  - Use the standard Python approach
    - Create virtual environments for Python versions previously installed on
      your computer
    - Advantages of the standard Python approach:
      - Access to the latest packages from [[https://pypi.org][pip]] utility
  - Use Conda
    - Conda creates and manages *environments*, which are similar to virtual
      environments, with some improvements
      - Added flexibility. You can create virtual environments that use Python
        versions not yet installed on your computer
      - Use the ~conda~ utility to manage environments, add/remove packages, etc.
      - Environments are journaled, so that you can return to a previous version
        of your environment
        - This is useful if you install package Y, but it conflicts with other
          packages in your environment
        - You can simply restore your environment to an earlier version
    - Drawbacks
      - Packages on [[https://conda-forge.org][conda-forge]], the package repository for ~conda~ may not be up to
        date with the ones on PyPI, the repository for standard Python packages
        - You can still install packages from PyPI in ~conda~ environments, however
*** Benefits of Using Python Virtual Environments

**** Why Use Virtual Environments in Python?
***** Isolation of Dependencies
- Avoid conflicts between package versions required by different projects.
- Each project can have its own dependencies without interfering with others.

***** Consistency Across Environments
- Reproduce the same environment for development, testing, and production.
- Ensure compatibility and avoid "it works on my machine" problems.

***** Simplified Dependency Management
- Install project-specific packages without requiring administrative privileges.
- Cleanly manage updates or removals of packages for a single project.

***** Protection of Global Python Environment
- Prevent unintended modifications to the global Python environment.
- Avoid accidental installation of packages that could affect other projects.

***** Flexibility with Python Versions
- Use different Python versions for different projects.
- Test projects under multiple Python versions without conflicts.

***** Integration with Development Tools
- Tools like Jupyter, nbgrader, and linters work seamlessly with the virtual environment.
- Specific configurations (e.g., pylint, mypy) can be tied to the project environment.

***** Ease of Collaboration
- Use a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` file to share the exact environment with team members.
- Simplifies onboarding for new collaborators.

***** Best Practices
- Always activate the virtual environment when working on the project.
- Use tools like `venv`, `virtualenv`, or `conda` to create and manage environments.
- Leverage environment management tools like `direnv` for seamless activation.
** Procedure
*** Overview

We provides some guidance on installing Python.

#+begin_note
If you're a student in one of my courses, please make sure you install the
correct release of Python, as listed in Table [[tab:PyVersion]].

#+name: tab:PyVersion
#+caption: Python versions for various courses.
|------+----------+-------------------+---------|
| Year | Semester | Course            | Release |
|------+----------+-------------------+---------|
| 2025 | Spring   | Quantum Computing |    3.11 |
|------+----------+-------------------+---------|
| 2024 | Spring   | Quantum Computing |    3.10 |
|------+----------+-------------------+---------|
#+end_note

There are two ways I suggest for installing Python:
1. Using [[https://anaconda.org][Anaconda]] (recommended)
2. Using standard Python from [[https://www.python.org/downloads/][python.org]] (not recommended, but if option 1 fails, try this)

#+begin_info
I recommend using Anaconda or Miniconda. They provide the flexibility to create environments with a specific Python version, even if you don't have that version installed yet. With standard Python, you can only create a virtual environment using a Python version that you already have installed.

Miniconda is simply a stripped-down version of Anaconda. [[https://docs.anaconda.com/getting-started/][Getting Started with
Anaconda]] has some discussion on when to choose one version over the other.

The video tutorial here does not include a Linux installation, nor does it
discuss installing Miniconda.

#+end_export

*** Anaconda Installation

#+begin_info
I recommend the Anaconda installation over Miniconda and standard Python. In
fact, most or all of the instructions in these tutorials assume you have
installed Anaconda, and you have the Anaconda Navigator included with Anaconda.
#+end_info
**** Mac OS
I'm a Mac user, so I know this one best.

#+begin_info
I recommend using the command-line installation. This has worked best for me in
terms of adding packages.
#+end_info

- From the download page, you can choose "[[https://www.anaconda.com/download#downloads/success][Get additional installers]]"
  - You can use the *Skip registration* link, or you may register your e-mail if
    you wish.
- Get the “Command Line Installer” appropriate for your computer
  - Intel processor: pick “64-Bit (Intel chip) Command Line ...”
  - Apple processor: pick “64-Bit (Apple silicon) Command Line ...”

∗ Follow the Mac [[https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/mac-os/#command-line-install][Command line install]] instructions
**** Windows
You can either install Anaconda/Miniconda natively in Windows, or you can use
[[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install][WSL]] to install it in Linux on your Windows machine.

For a windows installation:
- Go to the [[https://www.anaconda.com/download#downloads/success][Anaconda download]] page
  - Skip the registration, or register your e-mail as you see fit
**** UNIX/Linux
You are on your own, but I think it should be pretty straight-forward.
*** Miniconda Installation
I do not recommend a Miniconda installation at this time. However, if your
computer is tight on storage, this may be a better option than Anaconda.

#+begin_info
If you're a Windows user, I recommend Anaconda over Miniconda, sinc the Anaconda
Navigator app also includes a PowerShell prompt, where you can use terminal
commands to create enviroments and install packages.
#+end_info
I've never done this yet, but the Miniconda installers are on the [[https://www.anaconda.com/download/success][Anaconda
download]] page. You just have to scroll past the Anaconda installers.

There are [[https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/][installation instructions]] for Miniconda, with a procedure for
command-line installation.
*** Standard Python Installation
I do not recommend this installation at this time.

Visit the [[https://www.python.org/downloads/][download page]] and get the version of Python you wish to use.

Make sure you get the correct version if you're in one of my courses. Table
[[tab:PyVersion]] is a listing of my courses along with the required Python version.

** Test Your Python Installation
Let us test your Python operationally. A nice way to run Python is in Jupyter
Lab.

#+begin_note
This test assumes you already have =jupyter lab= installed, which you likely
have if you used Anaconda. If you used Miniconda or standard Python, you may not
have =jupyter lab=. If that's the case, we'll install it later after we make a
(virtual) environment. You can skip over the operational test for now.
#+end_note

To run Python, you can do the following:
1. Launch Jupyter Lab:
   1. On a Mac
      1. Open a Terminal window
      2. type ~jupyter lab~ followed by ~RETURN~ to launch Jupyter Lab
   2. On a PC
      1. Start the Anaconda Navigator
      2. Click the "Jupyter Lab" tile/icon
2. Once you have opened Jupyter Lab, a new web browser will arise with a Jupyter Lab graphical interface
   - You can begin coding once the Jupyter Lab window is open!

If you need help starting Jupyter Lab, please see my video
   #+begin_export html
   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dviOML11TqE?si=SMM-LUYWGB0w_mtl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
   #+end_export
*** A Hello World Program
Try using the code of Listing [[lst:helloworld]] as starting code.

#+name: lst:helloworld
#+caption: A "hello world" program is traditionally a beginner's first prgram in any new language.
#+begin_src python :exports both :results output -n
  print('hello world')
#+end_src

- Observations:
  - There is a ~print()~ command with a single argument
  - That argument is a ~string~, which is a sequence of characters
  - You can define a ~string~ by putting the character sequence between a pair
    single quotes (~'some text'~) or double quotes (i.e, ~"some text"~ - chose
    one or the other, but not both to define your ~string~)
  - ~print()~ does one thing: it makes the input ~string~ visible in the Python
    output

*** Python Version Check
- Another check you can perform is to make Python print its version, as shown
  in Listing [[lst:verCheck]]
  - We see that I'm using Python 3, version 3.11.7.
  - The ~#~ character is the beginning of an inline comment
    - The ~#~ character an any subsequent characters in that line of code are
      not evaluated
    - Comments are strictly for the human reader to aid in code understandability
      (very important)
    - Comments clarify code to others and clarify a thought process to oneself
#+name: lst:verCheck
#+caption: This code uses the built-in ~sys~ package to query the Python version.
#+begin_src python :results output :exports both
  import sys # make the sys package available for use
  print(sys.version) # print the version information
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: lst:verCheck
: 3.11.7 (main, Dec 15 2023, 12:09:56) [Clang 14.0.6 ]

* Set Up a Python Environment
#+include: "./back-to-index.org"

** Objectives
1. Create a Python environment in Conda.
2. Install extend that environment by adding required packages.
   1. Verify that the desired packages were installed
   2. Try coding in Python

** Overview 
Here is a video tutorial:

#+begin_warning
A warning about this video: I did not illustrate how to get a specific version
of Python, so when using ~conda create ...~, please add ~python=3.XX~, where ~xx~ is the appropriate release
number.
#+end_warning

#+begin_note
Please note: please use =pip install ...=, even though this video demonstrates
~conda install ...~.
#+end_note

#+end_export

The following sections provide detailed instructions for setting up an
enviornment using ~conda~.

** Create an Environment

*** Using =conda= (recommended)
To create an environment:

1. Open a terminal application
   1. On Windows, start the Anaconda Navigator and launch the Powershell
      application
   2. On a Mac, open a Terminal (or iTerm2) window
2. In the terminal, type
   #+begin_src shell :eval never
     conda create --name <EnvName> python=3.XX
   #+end_src
   and press RETURN (ENTER) to execue the command
   1. Here, you replace =<EnvName>= the the specific name you choose for
      your environment
   2. Short, simple names will be most effective
3. This creates your environment and specifies that we want to use
   Python 3.XX, where you replace =XX= by the numerical value from Table
   [[tab:PyVersion]]
   1. Newer versions of Python may not work well with Qiskit
4. You can verify that your environment is created by typing
   #+begin_src shell :eval never
     conda info --envs
   #+end_src
   1. If the environment appears in the resulting list, you have
      successfully created it
   2. Otherwise, you may need to try again
*** Using =venv= in Standard Python (not recommended)
To create an environment:

1. Open a terminal application
   1. On Windows, start the Anaconda Navigator and launch the Powershell
      application
   2. On a Mac, open a Terminal (or iTerm2) window
2. In the terminal,
   1. Type and customize the following OS-specific command, and press RETURN
      (ENTER) to execue the command: 
      1. Mac OS/UNIX/Linux
         #+begin_src shell :eval never
           python3.XX -m venv <path/to>/<EnvName>
         #+end_src
      2. Windows
         #+begin_src shell :eval never
           python3.XX -m venv <path\to>\<EnvName>
         #+end_src
   2. Here, you replace =<EnvName>= the the specific name you choose for
      your environment, and you can specify a path on your computer where the
      virtual environment files will be stored
      1. Short, simple environment names will be most effective
3. This creates your environment and specifies that we want to use
   Python 3.XX, where you replace =XX= by the numerical value from Table
   [[tab:PyVersion]]
   1. Newer versions of Python may not work well with Qiskit
** Activate your Environment
- After creating your environment--especially if this is the first
   environment youve created--it is likely that your base environment
   is active. This means your new environment is _not_ active.
- You can tell this by looking at the start of your prompt string
  - If it says =(base)=, then, then your base environment is active
 
*** Conda Activation
To activate you environment:
1. Type the following at the Powershell or Terminal
  prompt:
  #+begin_src shell :eval never
    conda activate <EnvName>
  #+end_src

   1. This activates your environment so that you can:
      1. install packages or
      2. use the packages you previously installed in that environment
#+begin_info
You can deactivate your environment by typing =conda deactivate= at
the Powershell/Terminal prompt, but don't do that yet. We need to keep our
environment active so we can extend it by installing packages.
#+end_info

*** Virtual Environment Activation (Standard Python)
To activate you environment:
1. Choose the appropriate command for your OS and enter it a the Powershell or
   Terminal prompt:
   1. Mac OS/UNIX/Linux
      #+begin_src shell :eval never
        source <path/to>/<EnvName>/bin/activate
      #+end_src
   2. Windows
      #+begin_src shell :eval never
        <path\to>\<EnvName>\Scripts\activate
      #+end_src
2. This activates your environment so that you can:
   1. install packages or
   2. use the packages you previously installed in that environment
#+begin_info
You can deactivate your environment by typing =deactivate= at
the Powershell/Terminal prompt, but don't do that yet. We need to keep our
environment active so we can extend it by installing packages.
#+end_info

** Installing Packages
We will install the packages you need for this course. The preferred way will be
to use the ~requirements.txt~ file, which installs all the packages I want you
to have. If that fails, we can try the manual method.
*** Install Packages from a Requirements File (Recommended)

1. Make sure your desired conda environment (or virtual environment) is active
2. Copy and paste the following command
   into the Terminal or Powershell:
   #+begin_src shell :eval never
     pip install -r https://enriquepacis.github.io/BU-ECE-IntroQuantumComputing/python/requirementsQIS.txt
   #+end_src

   #+begin_info
   This command points to a file ~requirementsQIS.txt~, which is hosted on
   GitHub. It contains information about which packages you need for my course.
   #+end_info
  

*** Manual Install (not recommended)
If you're here, we may assume your install from the requirements file failed, or
you just want to do things the hard(er) way.
- For this course, you must install packages for your new environment
- Here, we will focus on the following:
  - =jupyterlab= - allows for an interactive session in your new
    environment (its installed by default in the =base= environment)
  - =qiskit= - allows you to develop quantum computing circuits
  - =qiskit-aer= - allows you to simulate quantum circuits
  - =matplotlib= - helps you visualize quantum circuits
  - =pylatexenc= - helps you visualize quantum circuits in a nicer
    way than the default

- For a walk-through on the manual package installation, see my video
  [[https://youtu.be/MQUu_ZwxViA][A Python Environment for Quantum Computing]]

To manually install packages in an environment:

1. Open the Powershell or Terminal as needed
2. Activate the desired environment
3. For each package to be installed, enter in the command prompt:
   #+begin_src shell :eval never
     pip install <packagename>
   #+end_src


*** Verify Package Installation

To verify that your packages were installed:
1. Use the following command in the Terminal/PowerShell:
   #+begin_src shell
     pip list
   #+end_src
   This will list all the packages installed in your active Python environment,
   along with their version numbers.
2. Check that packages such as =jupyter=, =matplotlib=, =pylatexenc=, and
   =qiskit= are listed in your result.

If you see the desired packages, you have a good indication that your setup is
complete. The next step is to operationally test your installation.
** Notebook Setup                                                 :noexport:

The following is helpful if we want to have =org-mode= sessions linking
multiple code blocks /and/ we are using =direnv=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval never-export
(setq-local org-babel-python-command (expand-file-name "../.direnv/python-3.11/bin/python3"))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: /Users/enrique_blair/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/Teaching/GitHub/BU-ECE-IntroQuantumComputing/.direnv/python-3.11/bin/python3

#+begin_src python :results output :eval never-export
import sys

print(sys.executable)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: /Users/enrique_blair/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/Teaching/GitHub/BU-ECE-IntroQuantumComputing/.direnv/python-3.11/bin/python3


** Operational Test
Do your newly-installed Python packages work?

Let's find out by doing the following:

1. Launch Jupyter Lab:
   1. On a Mac
      1. Open a Terminal window
      2. type ~jupyter lab~ followed by ~RETURN~ to launch Jupyter Lab
   2. On a PC
      1. Start the Anaconda Navigator
      2. Click "Jupyter Lab" tile/icon
2. Try the following tests:
   1. Copy and paste the code of Listing [[lst:importqiskit]] into a Jupyter cell.
      #+name: lst:importqiskit
      #+caption: This imports the =qiskit= package and prints its version.
      #+begin_src python :results output :eval never-export :exports both :session test-qiskit -n
        import qiskit
        print(qiskit.__version__)
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS: lst:import-qiskit
      : 1.3.1

      You should expect to see =qiskit= version =1.X= after using =SHIFT+ENTER=
      to evaluate the cell.

   2. Copy and paste the code of Listing [[lst:testBuildQC]] into a Jupyter Lab
      cell, and evaluate it:
      #+name: lst:testBuildQC
      #+begin_src python :results output :eval never-export :exports code :session test-qiskit -n
        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

        qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
        qc.x(0)
        qc.h(1)

        qc.draw()
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS:

      #+begin_src python :results output :eval never-export :exports none :session test-qiskit -n
        import os
        from pathlib import Path

        curdir = os.getcwd()
        pardir = os.path.dirname(curdir)

        print(pardir)

        docsimg = os.path.join(pardir, 'docs', 'img')


        tgt = os.path.join('img', 'testQC.png')
        tgt2 = os.path.join(docsimg, 'testQC.png')

        Path(docsimg).mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)
        qc.draw( filename=tgt )
        qc.draw( filename=tgt2 )

        print(f'[[./{tgt}]]')

      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS:
      : /Users/enrique_blair/Library/CloudStorage/Box-Box/Teaching/GitHub/BU-ECE-IntroQuantumComputing
      : [[./img/testQC.png]]

      #+name: fig:firstQC
      #+attr_html: :width 300px
      #+caption: A simple quantum circuit built and visualized in =qiskit=. This will work only if =qiskit= is properly installed, along with =pylatexenc=.
      [[./img/testQC.png]]

      If your installation was successful, you may see a circuit image /like/
      that of Figure [[fig:firstQC]]. If your circuit rendering is a more
      rudimentary text-art-type drawing, despair not. You can customize your
      rendering as follows:

      1. On Mac OS/UNIX/Linux:

         1. Find your =qiskit= configuration directory. It should be
            =~/.qiskit/=, where =~= denotes your user directory (folder), and
            files or directories beginning with =.= are hidden configuration files.

         2. Inside the =~/.qiskit/= directory, add a file named =settings.conf=
            with the following contents:
            #+begin_src text :eval never :tangle "~/.qiskit/settings.conf" :padline none
              [default]
              circuit_drawer = mpl
              state_drawer = latex
            #+end_src

      2. Windows
         1. Place the =settings.conf= file described above in the appropriate folder.
            1. In Windows, the path typically is
               =C:\Users\<your_user_name>\.qiskit=
